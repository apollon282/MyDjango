Upgrade Notes - 0.3 to 0.4
==========================

In ``django-mptt`` 0.4, mptt.register() has been removed in favour of model inheritance.

Suppose you start with this, which works with ``django-mptt`` 0.3::

    class Node(models.Model):
        ...
    
    mptt.register(Node, order_insertion_by=['name'], parent_attr='padre')


First, Make your model a subclass of ``MPTTModel``, instead of ``models.Model``::

    from mptt.models import MPTTModel
    
    class Node(MPTTModel):
        ...

Then remove your call to ``mptt.register()``. If you were passing it keyword arguments, you should add them to an ``MPTTMeta`` inner class on the model::

    class Node(MPTTModel):
        ...
        class MPTTMeta:
            order_insertion_by = ['name']
            parent_attr = 'padre'

Done! You're all upgraded :) A couple more notes for more complex scenarios:


What if I'm already inheriting from something?
==============================================

If your model is already a subclass of an abstract model, it *should* be safe to use multiple inheritance::

    class Node(ParentModel, MPTTModel):
        ...

Isn't multiple inheritance evil? Well, maybe. However, the 
`Django model docs`_ don't forbid this, and as long as your other model doesn't have conflicting methods, it should be fine.

.. _`Django model docs`: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/#multiple-inheritance


Compatibility with 0.3 as well
==============================

If you're writing a library or reusable app that needs to work with older versions of django-mptt,
you'll need to update your code to handle both versions::

    from django.db import models
    try:
        from mptt.models import MPTTModel
    except ImportError:
        # django-mptt < 0.4
        MPTTModel = models.Model

    
    class Node(MPTTModel):
        ...
    
    mptt.register(Node)

If you had keyword arguments to ``mptt.register()``, they now belong in an ``MPTTMeta`` inner class on the model.
But to keep it compatible with 0.3, you can pass them to ``register()`` as well::

    class Node(MPTTModel):
        ...
        class MPTTMeta:
            order_insertion_by = ['name']
            parent_attr = 'padre'
    
    mptt.register(Node, **dict(Node._mptt_meta))
